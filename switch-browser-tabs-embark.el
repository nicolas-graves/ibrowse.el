;;; Commentary:
;; Switch between tabs from Emacs

;;; Code:

;; (require 'embark)

;; Ideas for some embark-actions
;; - send the url to embark-become or embark-act as a URL
;; - copy the url
;; - kill the tab
;; - activate the tab
;; - maybe do something with the tab title, like copy an org-link target ?
